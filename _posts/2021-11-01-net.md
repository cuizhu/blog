# Netmask

```c
Host A, ipA, netmask 255.255.0.0,   broadcast something
Host B, ipB, netmask 255.255.0.0,   receiving
Host C, ipC, netmask 255.255.255.0, receiving
```

A netmask is for dividing an IP address into subnet and host, so the
netmask should be setted correctlly. 

The above example, **Host C receives nothing** from Host A, but Host B works
normally, so don't forget the netmask except the IP and port;
